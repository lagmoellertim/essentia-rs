## Overview

`essentia-rs` gives Rust developers access to the powerful capabilities of Essentia for tasks such as:

- Audio signal processing
- Feature extraction (low-level, high-level, rhythm, pitch, etc.)
- Music information retrieval (MIR)

This crate wraps the Essentia C++ library using Rustâ€™s FFI capabilities and exposes a safe, ergonomic interface.
